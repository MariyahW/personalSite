## About <a name = "about"></a>

Beginning of portfolio website that has been built for skill based assessment for Perscholas. The site contains links to Github, a partial online resume, a page to contact me, as well as the starts of my blog. I previously had a site that was built with a drag and drop method. As I have been learning new skills I took the site down and have decided to build one instead. Allowing to show my growth.
